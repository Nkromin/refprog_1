In recent years, social media streams have represented vast amounts of
insightful information that can be used by organisations and users to understand
trends and users’ perceptions and help in making informed decisions. There is an increasing research and
development trend toward
developing algorithms and tools to analyse such data and support organisations and users alike in
developing and delivering better services to customers or use the information to themselves. In this
research-in-progress report, we have proposed a model for analyzing Twitter data. An
initial prototype was developed as a web-based application that allows users
to search for specific terms on Twitter; the retrieved results are presented and
visualised using the forms of a) a interactive web pages, using
different JS and CSS, and b) bar graphs. This initial prototype will represent the core engine of our project
and sentiment social media analysis.

<strong><u>Motivation and Overview</u></strong></br>
The rapid increase of social media in the recent years has provided users a platform to
voice their opinions.
There are many platforms available but the actively used are Facebook, Twitter and Google+. Twitter is
an
online social networking service that enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called
"tweets". Every tweets contains a hash tags with the short messages, users use the hash tags “#” before
tweets
to categorize the tweets which makes it easy to search. It is also observed that all Indian political party
representatives/ political leaders are very much active in Twitter to express their views and opinions.
In this work we have taken recent tweets of two major political parties (BJP and Congress) to Analyze the
tweet pattern of the respective parties.
<strong><u>Objective</u></strong></br>
Traditionally, conducting the above analysis
requires the prolonged process of designing, distributing and analysing research. Also,
customers may not take it seriously, making the results unreliable or biased. Nowadays,
people are more willing to share their opinions freely on social media. To contribute to
automating the process and understanding social stream data and to overcome these
challenges, our platform is designed on interpreting
social realities .
<strong><u>The Problem Statement</u></strong></br>
One potential problem faced by users is to believe the credibility of the source regarding elections. Less
than 10 years ago,
similar analysis would not have been possible, but due to the rise of social media
platforms such as Twitter, which have been conducive in evolving a speech
transparency culture, it is now possible to conduct such automated research and gain a

more reliable understanding of a user. As a result of the lack of
open source tools that offer similar analytical features, the another aim of this platform is to
develop analytical capabilities and services that can offer a comprehensive
understanding of the data posted by users on social media websites in order to
inform clients of how better to carry out their activities, including
product and service design. The rest of the project is designed on the primary use case, that is election
parties trasperency.
